I use the API - Chuck Norris jokes and made a little game, the sense that there are three buttons. One "Like the joke", the second "Do not like the joke" the third button "Next joke". When we have read Chuck's joke, we click on one of the buttons. When you select the button "Like" flies cowboy hat and sound of applause and Chuck says "I am glad you liked it, let's press the next joke", when you click "Do not like", then flies out his fist and Chuck in the face, but Chuck then says "I agree bad joke, let's press the next" and so on up to ten points, then depending on which button you pressed more, starts playing a different video, also about Chuck Norris.
